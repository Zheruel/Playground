1. Two sum -> https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Hash map, Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n),

2. Contains Duplicate -> https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/

Hash map, Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)

3. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock -> https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

Two pointers, Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1)

4. Valid Anagram -> https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/

Hash map, Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)

5. Valid Parentheses -> https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/

Hash map (stack), Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)

6. Product of Array Except Self -> https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

Just 2 for loops, Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(1) because you are allowed to ignore the output array in space complexity analysis
